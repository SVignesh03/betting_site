SYSTEM ANALYSIS

EXISTING SYSTEM:

The landscape of online betting predominantly relies on traditional platforms that may lack the user-friendly interface and real-time engagement that modern users seek.

The prevalent systems often necessitate manual processes for bet placement, and the lack of an interactive interface may result in a less engaging experience for users. Manual tracking of bets, winnings, and user activities can lead to inefficiencies and errors, affecting the overall user satisfaction and trust in the system.

Furthermore, the absence of a centralized database may impede the efficient management of user information and bet history. Users might face challenges in tracking their betting history or accessing relevant information promptly. The reliance on older technologies may also limit the system's scalability and adaptability to emerging trends in online betting.

In summary, the existing online betting systems may lack the dynamic and interactive features desired by users, potentially leading to a less engaging and efficient betting experience. Manual processes and outdated technologies may contribute to inefficiencies, errors, and limitations in scalability.
